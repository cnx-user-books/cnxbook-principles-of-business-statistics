If you read any newspaper or watch television, or use the Internet, you will see statistical information.  There are statistics about crime, sports, education, politics, and real estate.   Typically, when you read a newspaper article or watch a news program on television, you are given sample information.  With this information, you may make a decision about the correctness of a statement, claim, or "fact."   Statistical methods can help you make the "best educated guess." </para><para id="element-514">Since you will undoubtedly be given statistical information at some point in your life, you need to know some techniques to analyze the information thoughtfully.
